It is able to set local versions (to the application folder) and globally (until other specified)
Python pip follows the global version, unless a virtual environment is created, then all the pip packages will be installed there. 

`pyenv` manages multiple versions of Python itself.
`virtualenv`/`venv` manages virtual environments for a specific Python version.
`pyenv-virtualenv` manages virtual environments for across varying versions of Python.
